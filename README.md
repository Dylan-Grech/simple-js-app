This small project was done through the help of Career Foundry. Through this application, I managed to use the newly learned
skills which include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, BootStrap as well as JSON. The application shows a list of Pokemons, where you can
click on a button and a modal appears which displays the data of each pokemon.
